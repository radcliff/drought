#California D3rought

This basic single-page app leverages a government dataset, D3 and Firebase. Client side events drive dynamic changes to elements on the page. 

##Features
* Client-only app
* Drought severity data from the US Drought Monitor
* GeoJSON/TopoJSON files rendered as SVG elements with D3 geo
* Real-time document storage with Firebase(noSQL)
* Calls to Twitter API leveraging Codebird.js API wrapper

##In the future 
I would like to continue building out the automation of clipping the drought data and converting it to GeoJSON on the server side programmatically.
